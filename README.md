SERP Score AnalyzerDescriptionSERP Score Analyzer is a powerful command-line tool built with Python for performing automated SEO competitive analysis. This script takes a list of keywords and a list of competitor domains, scrapes Google search results using the reliable ScraperAPI service, and calculates a "Competition Score" for each keyword. It provides valuable insights by identifying which of your competitors are ranking in the top results and at what position. The final analysis is saved in both user-friendly CSV and machine-readable JSON formats, making it an ideal tool for SEO specialists, digital marketers, and developers.FeaturesBatch Keyword Processing: Analyzes multiple keywords at once by reading from a simple text file.Competitor Tracking: Monitors the search ranking of specified competitor domains for each keyword.Competition Score: Calculates a simple score (0-100) to quickly gauge the difficulty of ranking for a keyword.Robust Data Fetching: Uses ScraperAPI to avoid getting blocked by Google and ensure reliable data retrieval.Dual-Format Reporting: Generates comprehensive reports in both .csv (for spreadsheets) and .json (for other applications) formats.Resilient Network Logic: Includes an automatic retry mechanism to handle temporary network errors.Clean Architecture: Built with a modular structure that separates data fetching from analysis logic.InstallationFollow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.1.
